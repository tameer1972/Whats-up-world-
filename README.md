Beginner schtuff
well im kinda sort new to the whole coding thing, so some help would be hugely apreciated.
I'm doing thid because of my desire to make better phones and computers, like I REAAAALLLY like that sorta stuff.
I live in Dublin, Ireland so coding isnt as sought after nor is it a very developed franchise, but we do have the big leagues etting up here because of the huge demand in it and college graduates.
To be honest, i just wanna make a living off of making and developing cool shit, I wanna have a hand in engineering the future my guys!
